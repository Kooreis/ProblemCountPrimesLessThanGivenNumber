# Question: How do you count the number of primes less than a given number? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to the problem of counting the number of prime numbers less than a given number. The function `countPrimes(n)` uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify prime numbers. It begins by creating an array `isPrime` of length `n`, filled with boolean `true` values, representing potential prime numbers from 0 to `n - 1`. The values at index 0 and 1 are set to `false` as they are not prime numbers. The function then iterates over each number in the array starting from 2 (the smallest prime number), and if the number is prime (i.e., `isPrime[i]` is `true`), it marks all multiples of that number as not prime (i.e., `false`) by setting `isPrime[j]` to `false` in the inner loop. This process continues until the square of the number being checked is less than `n`, as any multiples of larger numbers would have already been marked as not prime. Finally, the function filters the `isPrime` array to include only `true` values and returns the length of this filtered array, which represents the count of prime numbers less than `n`. The result is then logged to the console.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses the same logic as the JavaScript version to solve the problem, but it is implemented differently. The TypeScript version uses two functions: `countPrimes` and `isPrime`, whereas the JavaScript version uses only one function: `countPrimes`.

In the JavaScript version, the `countPrimes` function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all primes less than the given number. It creates an array of boolean values, representing the numbers from 0 to `n - 1`. It then iterates over each number in the array, and if the number is prime, it marks its multiples as not prime. Finally, it counts and returns the number of primes in the array.

In the TypeScript version, the `countPrimes` function iterates from 2 to the given number and increments a counter for each prime number it encounters. The `isPrime` function checks if a number is prime by trying to divide it by all numbers up to its square root. If any division results in a whole number, then the number is not prime.

The TypeScript version also uses type annotations for function parameters and return types, which is a feature not available in JavaScript. This can help catch errors at compile time, making the code more robust and easier to understand.

The TypeScript version also uses template literals to log the result to the console, which is a more modern and flexible way to concatenate strings and variables compared to the JavaScript version.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the JavaScript version. Instead of using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, it uses a helper function `isPrime` to check if each number less than `n` is prime. If the number is prime, it increments a counter. The function `countPrimes` then returns this count.

The C++ version uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers less than `n`, and for each number, it calls the `isPrime` function. This function checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, if it's equal to 2, or if it's divisible by 2. If any of these conditions are true, it returns a boolean value accordingly. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any odd number up to its square root. If it is, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

The C++ version uses standard input/output for user interaction, while the JavaScript version uses a console log to display the result.

In terms of language features, the C++ version uses the `iostream` and `vector` libraries, while the JavaScript version uses an array and the `fill` and `filter` methods. The C++ version also uses the modulo operator to check for divisibility, while the JavaScript version uses the `continue` statement to skip to the next iteration of the loop.
